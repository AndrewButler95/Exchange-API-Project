# Exchange-API-Project

This is a project to create a API that standardises the response from different exchanges, into
a single format that can easily be used by other scripts.

It has 3 main components.

There is the "index.js" file, this is the file used to run the project. It uses express to 
create api endpoints to list; the exchanges included, the product pairs, ticker data, orderbook
data and trade data.

The exchangeScript file is used to make get requests to the actual exchange endpoints dependant on 
the endpoint selected to be called.

The config file is used by the exchangeScript to map to the correct exchange file. Each exchange file
has its own format conversion methods which are used by the exchangeScript. 

## To run the project:

"node index.js"

To get a list of exchanges

http://localhost:3000/exchanges

To get exchange data

http://localhost:3000/exchange/method/pair

Methods : [product, ticker, trade, orderbook]

Product : returns a array of pairs

If the method is product then "pair" can be any text but cannot be empty

Ticker : returns price and volume of the last 24hr for a exchange pair

Trade : returns trade data for a exchange pair

Orderbook : returns orderbook data for an exchange for a exchange pair
